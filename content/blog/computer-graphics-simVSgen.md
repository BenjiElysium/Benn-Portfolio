# Computer Graphics - Simulative vs. Generative

## Generative vs. Simulative

On the comparison of latent image diffusion and traditional computer graphics

### Generative Diffusion Process

1. **Data-Driven**: The features and patterns are learned and stored in a latent space representation.
2. **Generative**: It is a generative process, gradually building up details through a series of transformations.
3. **Mathematically Controlled**: The process is controlled by mathematical equations that guide the diffusion process, ensuring a gradual and stable development.

### Traditional Computer Graphics Processes

### 1. Path Tracers and Ray Tracing

1. **Physics-Based**: These are physics-based techniques that simulate the way light interacts with objects to generate images. They trace the paths of rays of light as they travel through a scene.
2. **Deterministic**: The processes are deterministic, following specific algorithms that simulate light paths and interactions based on the physical properties of the materials and lights in the scene: ***It always produce the same outcome given the same initial conditions.***

### Comparison and Contrast

1. **Generative vs. Simulative**: The latent diffusion process is more of a generative process, creating images from learned patterns and features, while traditional graphics processes like ray tracing are simulative, recreating the behavior of light and materials based on physical principles.
2. **Complexity of Processes**: Traditional graphics processes often involve a series of complex and computationally intensive steps (like ray tracing, multiple passes, etc.), while the latent diffusion process aims to generate images through a more streamlined, albeit mathematically complex, process.
3. **Flexibility and Control**: Traditional processes offer a high degree of control over individual elements of the image, allowing for detailed adjustments during the post-production stage. In contrast, the latent diffusion process is more automated, with the quality and characteristics of the output being primarily determined during the training phase.
4. **Final Output Quality**: Both processes aim to produce high-quality images, but they approach this goal from different angles - one through the simulation of physical processes and the other through the generation of images based on learned patterns and features.

## Bring it Together

**Hybrid Rendering Techniques**: Combining the simulative processes of traditional CGI, like ray tracing which simulates light paths, with the generative capabilities of latent diffusion toward a a hybrid rendering technique. **This technique could potentially generate images** that not only adhere to physical principles but also incorporate learned patterns and features from the image training sets.
