# Computer Graphics - Simulative vs. Generative

## Generative vs. Simulative

On the comparison of latent image diffusion and traditional computer graphics

### Generative Diffusion Process

1. **Data-Driven**: The features and patterns are learned and stored in a latent space representation.
2. **Generative**: It is a generative process, gradually building up details through a series of transformations.
3. **Mathematically Controlled**: The process is controlled by mathematical equations that guide the diffusion process, ensuring a gradual and stable development.

### Traditional Computer Graphics Processes

### 1. Path Tracers and Ray Tracing

1. **Physics-Based**: These are physics-based techniques that simulate the way light interacts with objects to generate images. They trace the paths of rays of light as they travel through a scene.
2. **Deterministic**: The processes are deterministic, following specific algorithms that simulate light paths and interactions based on the physical properties of the materials and lights in the scene: ***It always produce the same outcome given the same initial conditions.***

### Comparison and Contrast

1. **Generative vs. Simulative**: The latent diffusion process is more of a generative process, creating images from learned patterns and features, while traditional graphics processes like ray tracing are simulative, recreating the behavior of light and materials based on physical principles.
2. **Complexity of Processes**: Traditional graphics processes often involve a series of complex and computationally intensive steps (like ray tracing, multiple passes, etc.), while the latent diffusion process aims to generate images through a more streamlined, albeit mathematically complex, process.
3. **Flexibility and Control**: Traditional processes offer a high degree of control over individual elements of the image, allowing for detailed adjustments during the post-production stage. In contrast, the latent diffusion process is more automated, with the quality and characteristics of the output being primarily determined during the training phase.
4. **Final Output Quality**: Both processes aim to produce high-quality images, but they approach this goal from different angles - one through the simulation of physical processes and the other through the generation of images based on learned patterns and features.

## Bring it Together

**Hybrid Rendering Techniques**: Combining the simulative processes of traditional CGI, like ray tracing which simulates light paths, with the generative capabilities of latent diffusion toward a a hybrid rendering technique. **This technique could potentially generate images** that not only adhere to physical principles but also incorporate learned patterns and features from the image training sets.

## AI Render Plugin for Blender

"AI-Render" is a project hosted on GitHub that integrates Stable Diffusion technology into Blender, a popular 3D creation suite. This combination allows users to leverage the capabilities of Stable Diffusion, an advanced AI model for image synthesis, within the Blender environment. The project is focused on enhancing the creative and production processes in 3D modeling and animation by utilizing AI-driven image generation techniques. The project is developed primarily in Python and is licensed under the MIT license. For a detailed overview and access to the project's resources, you can visit the GitHub page of AI-Render.
