# ComfyUI - what is it?

My journey into local image diffusion began with Automatic1111 in late 2022.
Automatic1111 provides a web-based interface for Stable Diffusion, making it more accessible and easier to use. Instead of interacting with the model through code or command line, users can use this web UI to input their prompts, adjust settings, and generate images. It's designed to simplify the process, allowing users to leverage the power of Stable Diffusion without needing deep technical know-how.

Automatic1111 utilizes Gradio to provide a web UI for Stable Diffusion, enabling users to interact with the model through a browser-based interface. This setup makes it much more user-friendly, especially for those who aren't comfortable with command-line tools or programming.

Actually, I started with running Google colab notebooks that were created to run stable diffusion models. I was delighted to use notebooks created by the Deforum developers, who develop methods and tools that allow users to create animations from the images generated by text-to-image models. We'll come back to animation in a bit. The cool thing about using Google Colab notebooks is that they allow you to run code in the cloud, which is a great way to get started with Stable Diffusion; so no local installation is required. This was cool but I wanted to have more control and that led me to Automatic1111.

About 9 months ago, one of the YT creators I follow released a video about ComfyUI. This is a node based interface for running Stable Diffusion models. I have have used several node-based interfaces over the years in computer graphics production environments from Unreal Blueprints, to Maya and most notably Nuke. The latter being the one of the standard applications for compositing image and video elements into a final product. I describe ComfyUI as the Nuke of Stable Diffusion applications.

## Node Graph Architecture
What exactly is a node graph? Okay, let's delve into this concept. A node graph is a type of visual programming language; and serve as a visual representation of a process that's easy to understand and visualize. It's also a way of representing a process in a way that's easy to modify. The history of node graphs started in the 1960s and today are used in a wide variety of applications, particularly in the fields of computer graphics, games, and machine learning.

I started using node graphs in 3D applications like SoftImage and Maya. Flame compositing systems used them as did other compositing applications like Shake and then came Nuke, a widely used compositing application developed by Digital Domain in the 1990s. It was released commercially and eventually acquired by the Foundry. Most of the applications that use a node-based architecture do so for specific modes. In the case of Nuke - it's all node-based.

Below are some images of node graphs in various applications.

## Maya - My 3D Application of choice for 20 years

## Unreal - Blueprints (Game Engine)

## Unreal - Madness!

So that brings us to ComfyUI - the Nuke of Stable Diffusion. It is essentially are in on the concept, it is open-source (unlike the others mentioned above) and relatively easy to modify and use. In terms of the user experience, I would recommend Automatic1111 for new users of this exciting technology. There are even more basic web-based systems that can be used to generate images from text, but if you're actually reading this blog, it's likely that you want to dig deeper. Automatic1111 is also open-source and almost everything that you can access with ComfyUI is available to you. However, it's not node-based and not as easy to create customized image diffusion systems. This is the beauty of ComfyUI - the permutations are endless.
