# ComfyUI - what is it?

My exploration into local image diffusion began with discovering Automatic1111 in late 2022. Automatic1111 offers a user-friendly, web-based interface for Stable Diffusion, transforming it into a more accessible tool. Instead of the typical code or command-line interactions, this web UI allows users to input prompts, adjust settings, and generate images effortlessly. It's tailored to make the process more straightforward, enabling users to harness Stable Diffusion's capabilities without requiring extensive technical knowledge.

At its core, Automatic1111 leverages Gradio to provide this browser-based interface, significantly enhancing user-friendliness, particularly for those less acquainted with command-line tools or coding.

Originally, my journey started with running Google Colab notebooks designed for Stable Diffusion models. I was particularly impressed by notebooks from Deforum developers. They specialize in developing methods and tools for creating animations from images generated by text-to-image models. More on animation later. The advantage of Google Colab notebooks lies in their cloud-based execution, allowing easy experimentation with Stable Diffusion without local installations. However, seeking greater control, I transitioned to Automatic1111.

About nine months ago, a YouTube creator I follow introduced ComfyUI. This node-based interface for running Stable Diffusion models resonated with me due to my experience with various node-based interfaces in computer graphics production, such as Unreal Blueprints, Maya, and notably Nuke. Nuke, in particular, is a standard in compositing image and video elements into final products. I liken ComfyUI to being the Nuke for Stable Diffusion applications.

## Node Graph Architecture

So, what exactly is a node graph? Let's dive into this concept. A node graph is a form of visual programming language that offers an intuitive representation of a process, making it easy to understand, visualize, and modify. The inception of node graphs dates back to the 1960s, and today, they are integral in various fields, including computer graphics, gaming, and machine learning.

My initial encounter with node graphs was in 3D applications like SoftImage and Maya. They were also fundamental in Flame compositing systems and other applications like Shake. Then came Nuke, a widely celebrated compositing application developed by Digital Domain in the 1990s, later commercialized and acquired by the Foundry. Nuke stands out for its exclusive reliance on a node-based architecture, unlike other applications that employ it for specific modes.

Below are some examples of node graphs in various applications.

## Softimage circa (2000s?)

And now, we arrive at ComfyUI - the Nuke of Stable Diffusion. What sets ComfyUI apart is its open-source nature, unlike the other applications I've mentioned. It's relatively user-friendly, both in terms of modification and use. For those new to this exhilarating field, I'd recommend starting with Automatic1111. It's an ideal gateway for newcomers due to its straightforward, web-based interface for generating images from text.

Yet, if you're delving into this blog, chances are you're eager to explore beyond the basics. Like ComfyUI, Automatic1111 is open-source, offering a robust array of features. But it doesnâ€™t use a node-based system, making it slightly less flexible in creating customized image diffusion systems. This is where ComfyUI truly shines - it offers endless possibilities for customization and experimentation.

In essence, while Automatic1111 provides a solid foundation for beginners, ComfyUI opens up a world of creative freedom for those ready to delve deeper into the intricacies of image diffusion.
